# tango-serial-to-ridgesoft-bot

This project started from mik3y's usb-serial-for-android project, link: https://github.com/mik3y/usb-serial-for-android

We are adding to it for a school project in CSCI455 Embedded Systems Robotics at Montana State University. We are going to use a Tango tablet and Tango area learning to control a Ridgesoft bot in its navigation around the robotics lab room here at MSU.
